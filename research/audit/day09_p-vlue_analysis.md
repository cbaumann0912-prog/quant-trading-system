# Day 09 — p-Value Table: All Strategies

## Objective
Compute p-values and effect sizes for all strategies in the framework. Identify any mismatch between statistical significance and economic significance.

## Methods
- Test: one-sample t-test against null mean = 0
- Significance level: α = 0.05
- Effect size: Cohen's d vs s&p500 buy and hold benchmark

## Results
| Strategy | t-stat | p-value | Cohen's d | Reject H₀ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BOS FVG Reversal |6.06|6.47e-09|0.33|True|

## Finding: Statistical vs Economic Significance
With a p-value of 6.47e-09, well below α = 0.05, the mean daily return is statistically significant. However, Cohen's d of 0.33 indicates a small effect size, meaning the strategy's edge over buying and holding the S&P 500 over the same period is statistically detectable but economically modest.

## Conclusion
The BOS FVG Reversal strategy has a p-value of 6.47e-09 and Sharpe ratio of 1.60 which are statistically significant by any measure. Cohen's d puts the edge over a buy-and-hold S&P position in the small range. The strategy trades infrequently (~200 trades over 15 years), so most days are flat, which drags the mean return down. The risk profile is also different — max drawdown of -5.36% vs. far worse for the S&P over the same window. Whether that's enough to act on depends on what else is on the table.
